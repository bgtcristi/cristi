About Me

I am passionate about blockchain development, automation, and trading systems.
My goal is to create tools that are:

🔓 Open-source – free for everyone to study, improve, and adapt.

⚡ Modular – easy to extend with new strategies and integrations.

🤝 Community-driven – anyone can contribute or build on top.
